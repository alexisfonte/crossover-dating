# Crossover Dating App

> Dating app with instant chatting capabilities built with React, Ruby on Rails, Action Cable, Active Record and Action Mailer

Crossover is a full-stack project built with a React Frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend, that allows users to match with their favorite 90's cartoon characters and chat with real time messages. This app was created as my Phase 4 project for Flatiron school and recently restyled.

This app features full user authentication and authorization, react time messaging and matching using WebSockets, and allows users to easily create and edit their profile, as well as view other user's profiles.

## Acknowledgements

This project was created as my Phase 4 project for Flatiron School.

The card swiping fucntionality was inspired by Tinder, and the styling is inspired by MTV's classic moody aesthetic.

Big thank you to Ania Kub√≥w's [Tinder Clone Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q70IMS-Qnjk&t=7250s) which inspired me to create the project and helped tremendously with the starter code setup.

I also wanted to thank [this article](https://blog.devgenius.io/integrate-action-cable-with-react-and-ruby-on-rails-to-build-a-one-to-one-chatting-app-4f0feb5479e6) that helped me understand how to setup Action Cable.
